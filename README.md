We will be examining the maple sugaring season as it pertains to MacLeish.
Using the maple_sap data set on gallons of sap collected and the weather data,
we predict the start date, end date, and yield for sugaring season. We utilize the MacLeish package to
examine the weather patterns at the field station during the harvest, as well as using the spatial
data of nearby maple sugarhouses in southwestern Massachusetts. We hope to use maple collection data to
further extrapolate our weather information.

The important parts of weather that relate to sap collection are the temperature and pressure of the
environment.
